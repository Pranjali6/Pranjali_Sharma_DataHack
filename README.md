With the ever-increasing importance of vaccination in controlling flu outbreaks, predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving vaccines has significant public health implications. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the probabilities of individuals receiving both xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The predictions are based on a comprehensive dataset encompassing various demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Understanding and Preprocessing: Gain insights into the dataset and preprocess it to ensure the features are in a suitable format for model training.
Model Development: Develop machine learning models to predict the probabilities of receiving the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the models using the ROC AUC metric to ensure accurate predictions.
Interpretability and Insights: Provide insights into the significant factors influencing vaccination probabilities and interpret the model results.

Dataset
The dataset comprises 36 columns, including a unique respondent identifier and 35 features detailing demographics, behaviors, health conditions, and opinions. Key features include:

Demographic Information: Age group, education level, race, sex, income level, marital status, housing situation, employment status, and geographic location.
Behavioral Factors: Actions taken to prevent flu spread, such as taking antiviral medications, avoiding large gatherings, and using face masks.
Health-related Information: Chronic medical conditions, regular contact with young children, healthcare worker status, and health insurance coverage.
Opinions and Concerns: Levels of concern and knowledge about the xyz flu, perceived effectiveness and risks of vaccines, and worries about getting sick from vaccines.
